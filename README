smotd - simple message of the day

Usage:
    smotd message_file .smotd_hist [-i interval]

Description:
    Ideally, smotd should be run from a script which is executed regularly
    (from .bashrc for example). It will print the contents of message_file to
    stdout, write the current time and date to the history file (.smotd_hist in
    this case) and exit.

Installing:
    clone the repository and run `go install`.

Options:
    -i interval
        Makes smotd print the message every `interval` seconds. For example,
        `smotd message.txt .smotd_history -i 7200` will make smotd check if 7200
        seconds (2 hours) passed since the last time the message was shown and
        if so will update .smotd_history and print message.txt to stdout.

    -h, --help
        Show this help text and exit.
