smotd - simple message of the day
usage: smotd message_file .smotd_hist [-i interval]

Ideally, smotd should be run from a script which is executed regularly
(from .bashrc for example). It will print the contents of message_file to
stdout, write the current time and date to the history file (.smotd_hist in
this case) and exit.

INSTALLING:
    clone the repository and run `go install`.

OPTIONS:
	-i interval_in_seconds
		When used, must also include a positive integer interval_in_seconds. For
		example: `smotd message.txt .smotd_history -i 7200`
		This will make smotd check if 7200 seconds (2 hours) passed since the last
		time the message was shown and if so will update .smotd_history and print
		message.txt to stdout.

	-h, --help
		Show this help text and exit.
